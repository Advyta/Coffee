    title: "Planting",
    text: `Coffee trees thrive in a specific region along the equator known as “The Bean Belt,” between 25° North and 30° South. In this area, Arabica coffee grows at high altitudes in mineral-rich soil, requiring more care and cooler temperatures. Robusta, true to its name, is a hardier plant that thrives in hotter climates and lower altitudes. 

The coffee we love comes from the seed inside a fruit called the “coffee cherry.” This seed, known as the “coffee bean,” starts out light green or yellowish, depending on the type (Arabica or Robusta). When processed—pulped, roasted, and ground—it becomes the coffee we brew. Coffee plants begin as seedlings in shaded nurseries, where they are nurtured until strong enough to be planted. After about 15 months, these seedlings are moved to their permanent location, usually during the rainy season to help their roots establish. It takes around four years for a coffee tree to bear fruit and produce coffee cherries.`,

    step: 2,
    title: "Harvesting",
    text: `Newly planted coffee trees take about 3 to 4 years to produce fruit, known as coffee cherries. These cherries turn a bright red when ripe and ready for harvest. Typically, there's one major harvest each year, but in countries like Colombia, where coffee flowers twice annually, there’s a main and secondary crop.

In most coffee-growing regions, harvesting is done by hand, a labor-intensive process. However, in flatter areas like Brazil, where coffee fields are vast, mechanized harvesting is common. There are two main harvesting methods:

1. STRIP PICKING: 
All cherries are stripped from the branch at once, either by hand or machine, without considering ripeness.
  
2. SELECTIVE PICKING:
Only the ripe cherries are carefully picked by hand. This method, though more labor-intensive and costly, is used for high-quality Arabica beans. Skilled pickers rotate through the fields every 8-10 days, choosing only the ripest cherries.

A good picker can harvest 100 to 200 pounds of coffee cherries a day, yielding 20 to 40 pounds of coffee beans. The day's haul is weighed, and pickers are paid based on their work before the cherries are sent to the processing plant.

Selective picking is favored for high-quality coffee, while stripping prioritizes speed and cost, often resulting in a mix of cherries at different ripeness levels that need sorting later.`,

  {
    step: 3,
    title: "Processing the Cherries",
    text: `After coffee cherries are harvested, they can be processed in one of three main ways: Washed, Dry (Natural), or Honey.

1. WASHED PROCESS: 
In the washed method, water is used to cleanly separate the fruit from the bean, highlighting the pure characteristics of the coffee. While this method requires a lot of water, newer techniques are reducing water waste. This process is excellent for appreciating the unique flavors of single-origin coffees.

2. DRY (NATURAL) PROCESS: 
The traditional dry method involves drying coffee cherries in the sun before separating the fruit from the bean. Though it’s cost-effective and eco-friendly, it can lead to inconsistent flavors if unripe cherries are mixed in. When done well, this method produces beans with sweet, fruity notes as the beans absorb qualities from the drying cherries.

3. HONEY PROCESS: 
The honey process is a hybrid between the washed and dry methods. It uses water to remove most of the fruit but leaves some sticky mucilage (the “honey”) on the beans, which are then dried in the sun. This method balances the bean's natural flavors with the sweetness of the fruit. It’s popular in regions like Costa Rica and has various subcategories, such as Yellow, Red, and Black Honey, each offering different flavor profiles.

In all methods, timely processing after picking is crucial to prevent spoilage. The dry method is often used in regions with limited water resources, while the washed method is common in areas where water is plentiful. The honey method offers a middle ground, preserving the bean’s natural qualities while adding a touch of sweetness.`,

    title: "Drying the Beans",
    text: `If the beans have been processed by the wet method, the pulped and fermented beans must now be dried to approximately 11% moisture to properly prepare them for storage. 
These beans, still inside the parchment envelope (the endocarp), can be sun-dried by spreading them on drying tables or floors, where they are turned regularly, or they can be machine-dried in large tumblers. The dried beans are known as parchment coffee, and are warehoused in jute or sisal bags until they are readied for export. `,

    step: 5,
    title: "Milling the Beans",
    text: `Parchment coffee undergoes several key processing steps:

1. HULLING: 
For wet-processed coffee, hulling removes the parchment layer (endocarp) from the beans. In dry processing, hulling removes the entire dried husk, including the exocarp, mesocarp, and endocarp.

2. POLISHING (Optional): 
Polishing removes any remaining silver skin from the beans. While polished beans may look superior, there’s little difference in quality compared to unpolished ones.

3. GRADING AND SORTING: 
Beans are graded by size and weight and checked for color flaws or imperfections. They pass through a series of screens to determine size, represented on a scale of 10 to 20, corresponding to the diameter of a round hole in 1/64th-inch increments. For example, a size 10 bean is 10/64 of an inch in diameter.

4. DEFECT REMOVAL: 
Defective beans—those with flaws like improper size, color, or damage—are removed either by hand or machine. This step ensures that only the highest quality beans make it to market.

These careful processing steps are essential to producing the premium coffee we enjoy!`,

    text: `It is thanks to the roasting process that we get that distinctive dark color of our beloved drink

This process, in our opinion, is 50% art and 50% science as roast masters have to experiment but also have a great sense of how each coffee will behave with the different temperatures.

This step is crucial for achieving a great beverage, as a difference of a few seconds or a few degrees can separate an exceptional coffee from a mediocre one, so that’s why we at Essense only work with real artisans that are the best of their kind.

To be able to make a perfect roast you need a lot of experience, you need to have a flawless time and temperature control, and you must be able to recognise how to bring out the best of coffee.

TYPES OF ROASTS:
There are three main types of roasts: light, medium and dark, these have many subcategories.

1. LIGHT ROAST:
Light roasts are achieved through a roasting temperature that ranges from 180°c to 210°C. Around 205°C, coffee beans will pop much like popcorn, this “pop” is called the first crack, and light roasts usually don’t go beyond this first crack. Light roasts have more acidity than the other roasts, they have a light-brown color and conserve much of the bean’s caffeine.

2. MEDIUM ROASTS:
Medium roasts are achieved through a roasting temperature that ranges from 210°C to 230°C. In the darker spectrum of the medium roasts, there will be a second crack, but they tend not to go beyond that. Medium roasts have a balance between the body and the flavors, they have a medium-brown color and have less caffeine than lighter roasts.

3. DARK ROASTS:
Dark roasts are achieved through a roasting temperature that ranges from 230°C to 250°C. They usually go beyond the second crack. These kinds of roasts have a fuller body and a smokey taste, they have an almost black color and have less caffeine than the other types of roasts.`,

The type of grind will vary depending on the brewing method being used, so if you ask your trusted barista, he or she will tell you what type of grind is needed for your beverage.

Remember that if you are brewing at home, you should make sure to purchase the right kind of grind. Otherwise, you could buy whole-bean coffee and grind it yourself, this way you will be sure that is the right grind for your coffee-maker and you will be able to experiment with different grind variations to find the right one for you.`,

The right water temperature, brewing time, and coffee-to-water ratio are key to achieving the perfect cup.
    There are many different brewing methods which you can choose depending on the beverage you desire, there are four brewing categories:

1. POUR-OVER:
This method consists of passing hot or cold water through coffee while being filtered at the same time. 

2. STEEPING:
Also known as the immersion method, it consists of mixing hot water and coffee and separating the wet coffee grinds from the coffee. 

3. PRESSURE:
This method utilizes air pressure to brew coffee. 

4. BOILING:
This method is the oldest one in the book, and it consists as you may have guessed, on boiling water with coffee to obtain the beverage. `,
